# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

Your answer:
A parameter is a variable that acts as a placeholder for an argument or input value
An argument is the actual value that is passed into the the function through the parameter

Researched answer:
A parameter is a named variable passed into a function that is used to take in arguments into the function. 
An argument is the real value passed into the function through a parameter


2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

Your answer: 
The .map() takes in an array as a predefined parameter, iterates through the array and will return a new array of the same length. 

Researched answer:
The .map() method outputs a new array with results of calling a function on every element in the calling array. 



3. What is the difference between map and filter?

Your answer:
Map iterates through every element of an array and calls the function of every element - the result is returning a new array that is the same number of elements.
Filter iterates through the array and returns a subset of the array based on certain parameters.

Researched answer:
Map returns a new array of elements where a function has been executed on the elements so that the original element has changed. 
Filter returns a new array of the elements of the original array with no change to the original values



4. What is iteration?

Your answer:
Iteration is moving through the indexed location of an array from left to right. With a 'for' loop you can dictate what index location the iterations starts, what index location the iteration ends and how you would like to iterate through the array (every index location, every other index location, etc.).

Researched answer:
Iterations is traversing through an array and executing code once for each element in an array. 


5. What is the difference between a function and a method?

Your answer:
Both are chunks of code that perform a task but a method is associated with an object. 
A function uses 'return' to execute the function and return an output.
A method is invoked but using a period '.' to call on an object

Researched answer:
A method is solely passed on the object on which it is called.
A function is independent of any object 


6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

Your answer: 
Hoisting is when a variable is used before it is declared

Researched answer:
Hoisting is a default behavior in JavaScript that moves declarations to the top of the current scope. 
## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week



Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Component: Independent and reusable pieces of code, much like functions, that sends data back to the user interface through JSX. 

2. Spread operator: The spread operator (...) allows the copying of all or part of an array or object into another array or object. 

3. React state: A built-in object where proptery values that belong to a component are stored. The state object can be referred to in the component by using the this.state.propertyname syntax

4. React props: Props are arguments passed into components vis HTML attributes

5. DOM events: A signal that something has or is occuring and can be triggered by user or browser interactions. Example: when a user clikcs the mouse or when a web page has loaded.
